I have created this text file for testing puposes.


I am enjoying Hadoop Mapreduce to process the big data.


Hadoop is an open source distributed file storage system.


Hadoop is a file storage system on top of which mapreduce/yarn or spark can be used to process data.


Both programming paradigm has their own pros and cons.


Mapreduce/yarn is robust and can be scaled to any limit with cheap hardwares but is slow.


Spark is best suited for real time streaming but limited in scaling capabilities.


There are several other tools one shoud be familier with in order to be productive as a data scientist/engineer.


Vim editor and  awk programming language for text editing. For test unit one can use pytest a python extension. One should be familier with shell commands.



I think that's it. You are good to go!!
